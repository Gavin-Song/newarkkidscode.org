Main page and navbar for newarkkidscode.org by Ben Schack.

**Please not that file names cannot have spaces in them because they cannot be run locally.**

I am running this locally off a mac. For the links to work, you will probably have to change them.

Special features:
  -navbar compresses when page gets smaller.
  -most elements automatically resize.


Problems:
  -Since the navbar is fixed, whenever links are clicked they overlap with the navbar (they go under the navbar). Attempts to offset the links have not worked.
  -Some page compression issues.
  -Form does not do anything yet.
